Bed coverage by chromosome
==========================

Calculated using `bedtools summary <https://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/tools/summary.html>`_.

Table columns are:

- **chrom**
  
  - Chromosome name

- **chrom_length**
  
  - The length of the chromosome in bp

- **num_ivls**
  
  - The total number of intervals observed for the chromosome

- **total_ivl_bp**
  
  - The total number of bp observed in the intervals for the chromosome

- **chrom_frac_genome**
  
  - The fraction of the genome represented by the chromosome

- **frac_all_ivls**
  
  - The fraction of all intervals observed the chromosome

- **frac_all_bp**
  
  - The fraction of all bp observed the chromosome

- **min**
  
  - The smallest interval observed on that chromosome

- **max**
  
  - The largest interval observed on that chromosome

- **mean**
  
  - The mean interval length observed on that chromosome
