Bed coverage by chromosome. Calculated using `bedtools summary`(https://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/tools/summary.html). Table columns are 
1. chrom (chromosome name)
2. chrom_length (the length of the chromosome in bp)
3. num_ivls (the total number of intervals observed for the chromosome)
4. total_ivl_bp (the total number of bp observed in the intervals for the chromosome)
5. chrom_frac_genome (the fraction of the genome represented by the chromosome)
6. frac_all_ivls (the fraction of all intervals observed the chromosome)
7. frac_all_bp (the fraction of all bp observed the chromosome)
8. min (the smallest interval observed on that chromosome)
9. max (the largest interval observed on that chromosome)
10. mean (the mean interval length observed on that chromosome)
