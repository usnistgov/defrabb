# Milestone v0.009 TBD
- Common script for downloading files including md5 checksum

# Milestone v0.008 2022-06-06

- Using Truvari v3.2.0 with Bioconda package Issue #15

# Milestone v0.007 2022-05-09
- Draft benchmark sets for HG002 whole genome and XY only against CHM13v2
- Created wrapper script for running and archiving analysis runs.
- Added documentation for different stratification types
- Cleaned up issues related to running things on tibanna/ AWS

# Milestone v0.006 2022-04-18
- updated framework to allow for GRCh37 and CHM13 as references (yet to vet GRCh37 however) changes by JM, including modifications to schema's and rules as well as adding appropriate reference dependencies.
- added chm13 exclusions set to resources.yml
- moved .genome files to resources/references/
- Fixed issue with padding for rule `intersect_SVs_and_homopolymers` when adding slop resulted in a negative starting position.
- Added initial set of python function and snakemake rule unit tests.

# Milestone v0.005 2022-03-25
- Using Snakemake version 7.3 addresses issue with local runs, removed groups for local rules
- Added documentation for running pipeline on AWS using Tibanna
- Adding analyses.tsv tables for additional framework runs

# Milestone v0.004 2022-03-03
- Revising test dataset for easier local development
- Adding basic report functionality
- Modifying logging and run scipts to help with debugging when running on AWS via Tibanna
- Added documentation for running defrabb on AWS via Tibanna
- Added rules for indexing dipcall output bams and draft benchmark vcfs
- Initial optimization of dipcall and happy resource compute requirements
- Added initial funtionality for processing draft benchmark vcfs
- Revised and restructured resources.yml and schema for clearer documentation and easier use.
- Added analyses.tsv and updated resource config files for running framework on 44 HPRC genome and HG002 XY
- Cleaning up code and comments
- revised analyses schema for clarity, the API is still a work in progress, hope to make it more intuitive in future releases.
- Fixed exclusions; ensuring bed files are properly sorted, added slop to repeats before identifying regions to exclude, added config variables to clarify how exclusions are generated.

# Milestone v0.003 2022-01-28
- Version of pipeline used for generation and evaluation of the HG002 T2T assembly based draft benchmark set(HPRC-HG002-cur.20211005) with excluded regions.
- Modified framework into three components; asm-varcalls, benchmark, and evaluations.
- Repository clean-up, removing unused files and code, simiplifying results and log paths
- Modified config files, analyses.tsv and resources.yml to better handle stratifications.
- Added genome and satellites excluded files to the repo and moved rules to generate files to snippets.
- Added directive for benchmarking for use in evaluating step resource requirements.
- Updated test dataset and config files for additional testing
- Revised documentation for running pipeline and added CONTRIBUTING.md with milestone release process.
- Snakemake formatting and linting using Snakemake tools
- Documentation for running pipeline

# Milestone v0.002 2022-01-20
- This version of the pipeline was used to perform initial analysis of benchmark set performance using 
- Added functionality to excluded defined genomic regions of draft benchmark regions bed file
- Added utility scripts for running the pipeline on the CTCMS cluster
- New Chr21 test dataset for use in pipeline development
- Initial CI/CD setup
- Snakemake formatting and linting using Snakemake tools
- Documentation for running pipeline

# Milestone v0.001 2022-01-10
- First milestone 
- added schema's for analyses table, config, and resources yamls
- Added ability to define analyses run with a metadata table for documenting framework runs
- Using pathlib for handling file paths
- Implementing small variant benchmarking with happy and structural variant benchmarking with Truvari
