# Milestone v0.004 2022-02-28
- Revising test dataset for easier local development
- Adding basic report functionality
- Modifying logging and run scipts to help with debugging when running on AWS via Tibanna
- Added documentation for running defrabb on AWS via Tibanna
- Added rules for indexing dipcall output bams and draft benchmark vcfs
- Initial optimization of dipcall and happy resource compute requirements
- Revised and restructured resources.yml and schema for clearer documentation and easier use.
- Added analyses.tsv and updated resource config files for running framework on 44 HPRC genome and HG002 XY
- Cleaning up code and comments
- revised analyses schema for clarity, the API is still a work in progress, hope to make it more intuitive in future releases.
- Fixed exclusions; ensuring bed files are properly sorted, added slop to repeats before identifying regions to exclude, added config variables to clarify how exclusions are generated.

# Milestone v0.003 2022-01-28
- Version of pipeline used for generation and evaluation of the HG002 T2T assembly based draft benchmark set(HPRC-HG002-cur.20211005) with excluded regions.
- Modified framework into three components; asm-varcalls, benchmark, and evaluations.
- Repository clean-up, removing unused files and code, simiplifying results and log paths
- Modified config files, analyses.tsv and resources.yml to better handle stratifications.
- Added genome and satellites excluded files to the repo and moved rules to generate files to snippets.
- Added directive for benchmarking for use in evaluating step resource requirements.
- Updated test dataset and config files for additional testing
