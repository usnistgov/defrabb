## Milestone v0.012 2023-11-07

Numerous changes to repo aimed at improving usability and functionality.

- rewrote wrapper script in python for improved usability and easier development

- Fixed issue with truvari when base and comparison vcfs had different contig ids
- added bedtool summary to get chromosome level coverage stats for benchmark beds

- now using v3.3 of GIAB stratifications (<https://ftp-trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ReferenceSamples/giab/release/genome-stratifications/v3.3/>)
- improving output benchmark vcf - changed sample name in vcf from dipcall default
- fixing issue where gaps were not appropriately excluded, gaps are now determined from the ref fasta file
- using updated version of GRCh38 with additional masked regions as described in [FixItFelix paper](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-023-02863-7).
- added VDJ to exclusions

## Milestone v0.011 2023-07-25

Most changes in this release were making the run_defrabb script more user friendly and fixing bugs encountered
making XY benchmark, comparison to Sentieon SV callsets, and benchmarks for v0.09 of T2T HG002 assembly

- improving usability of run_defrabb script, keep going, number of jobs, extra snakemake args
- updated usage documentation
- updated config to use v3.1 stratifications and ftp version of reference
- new benchmarks based on v0.9 of HG002 T2T assembly

- Added snippets for $137 and $138 with gt30 imperfect homopolymers and HiFiDV XY discrepancies with HiFiasm
- adding environment definition and local version for use with defrabb run script
- adding gawk to conda envs for improved reproducibility

Notes: API and file naming changes broke unit tests, tests will be updated for next release
